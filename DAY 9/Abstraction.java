Abstraction(in simple pts):
    Hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user is called abstraction.
    It is one of the fundamental OOP concepts.
    It can be achieved by using abstract classes and interfaces in Java.

Abstact class: 
    An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is declared with the abstract keyword.
    It can have abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation).
    Abstract classes are used to provide a common base for subclasses to extend and implement the abstract methods.
